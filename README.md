specs:
As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe stores.
As a user, I want to be able to add and list new shoe brands. Shoe brands should include price point (for example: set values of low, middle, or high... or prices per shoe (if the store carries one model per brand)).
As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about integrating functionality to update or destroy individual shoe brands).
As a user, I want to be able to add existing shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.
As a user, I want to be able to associate the same brand of shoes with multiple stores.
As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
As a user, I want the price to be in currency format even if I just inputted a number. (In other words, typing in '50' should be updated to '$50.00'.)
As a user, I do not want stores and/or shoe brands to be saved if I enter a blank name.
As a user, I want all stores and brands to be unique. There shouldn't be two entries in the database for 'Blundstone', or 'Adidas'.
As a user, I want store and brand names to have a maximum of thirty characters.
